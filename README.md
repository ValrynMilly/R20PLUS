# Developer-notes
## In this section I will discuss what I would've wanted to include into the program or further processes I should have taken. 

### Dice rolling
It would have been nice to include a random dice roller so the user doesnt have to manually put in the attributes. This wouldve added to automation but with the time constraints that this project had it would have proven very difficult.
### Time window
Simple custom timers users can set to help them with their gameplay and campaign.
### Finances
Manage user finances much like attributes. Diamonds, Gold, Silver, Copper.
